    "Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where a model is trained on labeled data, meaning each input has a corresponding correct output. It is used for tasks like classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., stock price prediction). In contrast, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the model identifies patterns, structures, or relationships without predefined outputs. It is commonly used for clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal component analysis). While supervised learning focuses on making accurate predictions based on past data, unsupervised learning helps uncover hidden insights within raw data."
